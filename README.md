Iris Flower Classifier (Machine Learning + Streamlit) A simple Machine Learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the famous Iris dataset. The project is built with Python, Scikit-learn, Joblib, and Streamlit. Features:

1) Train a Random Forest Classifier on the Iris dataset
2) Evaluate model performance (accuracy + classification report)
3) Save and reuse the trained model (iris_model.joblib)
4) Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions

Technologies Used: Python 3.12 Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib Streamlit (for the web interface) Dataset Used This project uses the Iris Flower Dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. Source: Preloaded in scikit-learn (sklearn.datasets.load_iris()) Number of Samples: 150 flowers Features (4 total): Sepal Length (cm) Sepal Width (cm) Petal Length (cm) Petal Width (cm) Target Classes (3 flower types): Setosa Versicolor Virginica The goal of this project is to predict the species of a flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.
